# deeplearning
collection of jupyter notebooks for deep learning

- technically the gradient descent and lane detection don't use any deep learning, I might move them later.

#### Each notebook will download any needed dataset!

#### whats included:
- gradient descent (python file animates the descent optimization)
- lane detection (uses hough transform and includes a sample mp4 video)
- perceptron (the basic building block of all neural networks)
- multi (multi layer perceptron aka artificial neural network)
- binaryDNN (DNN for binary classification)
- mnist-DNN (DNN for the MNIST dataset)
- mnist-CNN (CNN for the MNIST dataset)
- traffic signs (CNN to classify the european road sign data set)
- regression (regression with keras)
- imitation learning (NVIDIA-CNN to train a car to drive!)
